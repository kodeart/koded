The caching for routes is the same as for anything else and
it is a "global" application caching. 

Setup cache
-----------

Caching configuration is done by [setting up the configuration](../utils/caching.md)
for the `App` instance.

Cache invalidation
------------------

At this time there are no tools or a mechanism to invalidate the router cache.
